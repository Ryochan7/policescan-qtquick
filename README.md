# policescan-qtquick

## 2019-09-13: I cannot get QtAV to work in Android anymore. This project 
is now considered defunct.

Simple application for listening to various police scanner web feeds made using
Qt Quick and QML. The scanner only has feeds for Peoria county and Tazewell
county in Illinois.
